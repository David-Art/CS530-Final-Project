# CS530-Final-Project
- Project: Laser Alarm Security System
The goal of the project is to create a simple laser security system with a Raspberry Pi.
In addition, we wanted to make sure that it was afforadable AND easily expandable.
Therefore, the raspberry pi was a perfect fit.

The GPIO library also provides a simple yet powerful functionality that allows the Pi hardware to interact with other devices, such as buttons, LED lights, etc.
